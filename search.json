    "text": "Once you learn vim and develop muscle memory, its quite hard to go back to a text editor that doesn’t have vim bindings. If you have a very customized set of vim bindings, the emulators available in certain text editors don’t do enough and can still be annoying.\nMy solution, partially inspired by tools like firenvim that bring a vim buffer where you are, was to launch a temporary vim buffer, write in it, and when I save and close the buffer, the vim and its container terminal window close and what I just wrote is typed into the vim-unfriendly buffer that I just had to deal with.\nThe first problem was an extra newline getting added when catting the file. I found a solution using perl that ‘chomps’ the final newline to remove it. Then the issue was getting it into the original editor. I tried to paste it but couldn’t find a way to programmatically paste - any xclip -o call only pasted into the calling terminal window. So I turned to xdotool to type it out. This worked but lost all newlines. I figured out how to preserve newlines by translating the linefeed (LF) \\n character to the carriage return (CR) \\r character. https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/399403/xdotools-type-mangles-carriage-returns\n#! /usr/bin/env zsh\n\nkitty --class flykitty \\\nnvim \\\n  -c 'set laststatus=0' \\\n  -c 'set spell' \\\n  -c 'source ~/.config/nvim/vim/autocorrect.vim' /tmp/temp_buffer\n\nperl -pe 'chomp if eof' /tmp/temp_buffer |\\\n  tr \\\\n \\\\r |\\\n  xdotool type --delay 0.5 -file -\nThis script launches neovim in a kitty window  with spell check and autocorrect, but without a status bar. Once saved, kitty exits and the output file is processed and typed out.the window has the ‘flykitty’ class because my i3 settings float every window of class ‘flykitty’ instead of tiling it"
