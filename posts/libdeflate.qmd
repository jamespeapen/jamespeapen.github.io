While looking for *htslib* sources that didn't require admin rights, I tried the
*htslib* from conda. Running the benchmarks again I saw that iscream got a lot
faster, up to twice as fast in some cases, with the conda *htslib* compared to the
*htslib* I was using on our HPC. I couldn't figure out why and, after a lot of
searching, I re-read the INSTALL manual which said

>     libdeflate (optional, but strongly recommended for faster gzip)

Examining the *htslib* object file in conda I saw that it was compiled with
libdeflate while the HPC *htslib* module was not.
